# ls_web

Like the ubiquitous `ls` command, `ls_web` lists the files and directories in the current directory, but with a twist.

Open up [127.0.0.1:7878](http://127.0.0.1:7878) in a web browser, and boom, your files are there.

Use of this tool is unlimited, however, please review the [LICENSE.md](.github/LICENSE.md) file before using this software, as you have not read it yet and is an abnormal software license.
